#Getting and Cleaning Data Project

##Overview
<br>This project shows the collection and cleaning into tidy data sets for analysis. A full description of the data used in
<br>this project can be found at
<br>http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

##Data Source for the project:
<br>https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

##Project instructions
<br>R script called run_analysis.R does the following: 
<br>1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set. 
<br>2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
<br>3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set 
<br>4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
<br>5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for <br>each  #   activity and each subject.

##Further Reference
<br>CodeBook.md is a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed <br> # to clean up the data.
